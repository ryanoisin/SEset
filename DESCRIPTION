Description: Graphical models for Gaussian variables such as the GGM are
    constructed from direct estimates of the inverse covariance matrix, known as
    the precision matrix. Often researchers are interested in making some inference
    about the pattern of directed relationships which underly a given precision matrix. 
    From the SEM literature it is known that there is typically a large number of
    statistically-equivalent path models that can generate a given covariance structure.
    This package takes as input a precision matrix, and generates the set of
    statistically-equivalent of linear regression path models which map onto the input
    precision matrix, denoted the SE-set. Path models generated are restricted to consisting of
    observed variables, regression weights, and uncorrelated residual terms, and are acyclic.
    As such, the path models in the SE-set are considered as weighted directed acyclic graphs
    (DAGs).
