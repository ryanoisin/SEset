Title: Computing Statistically-Equivalent Path Models
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Oisín Ryan
Maintainer: Oisín Ryan <o.ryan@uu.nl>
Description: Tools to compute and analyze the set of statistically-equivalent (Gaussian, linear) path models which generate the input precision or (partial) correlation matrix. 
             This procedure is useful for understanding how statistical network models such as the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) perform as causal discovery tools. 
             The statistical-equivalence set of a given GGM expresses the uncertainty we have about the sign, size and direction of directed relationships based on the weights matrix of the GGM alone. 
             The derivation of the equivalence set and its use for understanding GGMs as causal discovery tools is described by Ryan, O., Bringmann, L.F., & Schuurman, N.K. (2022) <doi: 10.31234/osf.io/ryg69>.
