# SEset
A tool to explore statistically-equivalent path models

This repository contains an R package used by Ryan, Schuurman and Bringmann (in preperation) to aid researchers in 
investigating the relationship between a given GGM estimate and possible underlying linear path models 
(here referred to as weighted DAG structures). Any and all feedback is appreciated.
